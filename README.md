# Crypto Analytics
### Background

We are building a website to predict the future price of crypto and the 
stock market. We will use crypto and stock API from CoinGeko, 
Yahoo Finance, and Polygon.io to gather our stock and crypto 
dataset. Our goal is to collect the top five crypto and stock; after 
collecting desired data, we will clean it using the Pandas library. We 
want to utilize machine learning to make future price predictions. We 
will analyze and visualize data to help users make decisions about 
purchasing cryptos and stocks. 

### Motivation
Since Pandemic, stock markets and cryptography have shown different 
patterns. Stock market was constantly up and broke some records but 
crypto the price has drastically fallen. Since Crypto & blockchain is the 
future for the web, we were highly interested in learning about those & 
would like to deep dive into it. 

### Questions to answer
- Which cryptos/stocks have a higher volume?
- Select a target cryptos/stocks and predict what is its highest price and
lowest price in the day?
- Which are the best crypto to buy and sell from the list of cryptos?
- Using pre-market volume to predict the daily volumes
- Using data to predict stock and crypto using machine learning.
